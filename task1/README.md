Based on the images, here is a GitHub `README.md` file that is well-formatted and explains the SoC design and verification flow.

# üöÄ **VLSI System Design (VSD) Program**

This repository documents the **System-on-a-Chip (SoC)** design and verification process, from high-level specification to final tape-out. It outlines the foundational steps and tool setups required for the program.

## üíª **Week 0: Foundation & Tool Setup**

**Status:** 

This week focused on setting up the development environment and installing the essential open-source tools that will be used throughout the program. The goal was to create a reliable and efficient workspace for synthesis, simulation, and design tasks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **System and Virtual Machine Configuration**

To ensure optimal performance, I configured a Virtual Machine (VM) with the following specifications:

| Specification | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operating System** | Ubuntu 20.04+ |
| **RAM** | 6GB |
| **Storage** | 50GB HDD |
| **vCPUs** | 4 |

> **üí° Pro Tip:** This setup guarantees sufficient resources for handling toolchain demands and running simulations smoothly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **The SoC Design & Verification Workflow**

The design process is broken down into distinct levels, each building upon the previous one. This structured approach ensures accuracy and efficiency.

### üéØ **Level 0: Chip Modeling**

This initial stage focuses on defining the chip's functionality using a **high-level behavioral model**.

  * **Objective:** To create a "golden reference" model for the chip's behavior.
  * **Implementation:** The design is implemented as a **C model** (O1).
  * **Verification:** A **testbench**, also written in C, is used to verify the C model's functionality. This ensures the core logic is sound before moving to hardware implementation.

### üèóÔ∏è **Level 1: RTL Architecture**

Here, the C model is translated into a hardware-specific description.

  * **Objective:** To create a **soft copy of the hardware** that describes the chip's digital logic.
  * **Implementation:** The design is written using a **Register-Transfer Level (RTL)** language like **Verilog** (O2).
  * **Architecture:** The design is partitioned into major functional blocks, such as the **Processor** and various **Peripherals/IPs** (Intellectual Property blocks).

### üõ†Ô∏è **Level 2 & 3: Synthesis & SoC Integration**

This phase transforms the RTL design into a physical circuit ready for fabrication.

  * **Synthesis (Level 2):** The RTL code is converted into a **Gate-Level Netlist** (O3), which is a description of the circuit using standard logic gates.
  * **SoC Integration (Level 3):** The gate-level netlist is combined with other elements like analog IPs and hard macros. This involves:
      * **Floorplanning:** Laying out the major blocks.
      * **Placement:** Positioning individual logic cells.
      * **Routing:** Connecting the cells with metal wires.

### üè≠ **Final Tape-Out: RTL to GDSII**

The final, integrated design is prepared for manufacturing.

  * **GDSII:** The final layout is saved in the industry-standard **GDSII** format, the blueprint for the chip.
  * **Final Checks:** Before fabrication, the design undergoes critical checks:
      * **DRC (Design Rule Check):** Ensures the layout meets the manufacturing rules of the foundry.
      * **LVS (Layout vs. Schematic):** Verifies that the physical layout accurately matches the original schematic.

This comprehensive flow ensures a robust and reliable design process from concept to final product.
